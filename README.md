Project 2 : Responsive Spotify Web Player

This project is a fully responsive, web-based music player inspired by Spotify, built entirely from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. No frameworks were used in the development process.

Key Features:

* Ultra-Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile devices.
* Pure Frontend Implementation: Achieves the desired functionality without requiring any backend components.
* Intuitive Interface: Mimics the look and feel of Spotify, offering a familiar user experience.
* Playback Controls: Provides essential controls for play, pause, volume, and track navigation.
* Simulated Playlist Support: Users can create and manage simulated playlists (local storage or session-based depending on implementation).
* Visualizations: Implement basic visualizations (e.g., progress bar, animated elements) to enhance user engagement.

Technical Details:

* HTML Structure: Uses semantic HTML for clear organization and accessibility.
* CSS Styling: Leverages media queries for responsive design and implements clean and maintainable code practices.
* JavaScript Functionality: Orchestrates player interactions, manages playback controls, and handles simulated playlist functionality.

Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/harshgupta372/Project-2-spotify-web-player

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

Limitations:

* Purely Static Music: This project focuses on the user interface and playback controls. It doesn't include actual music streaming functionality.
* Simulated playlists may have limitations depending on implementation (e.g., limited storage, data persistence).

Future Enhancements:

* API Integration: Integrate with a music streaming API (consider limitations and legal aspects) to enable playback of real songs.
* Advanced Features: Explore adding functionalities like user accounts, search bars, and social sharing (requires backend logic).
* Performance Optimization: Continuously evaluate and optimize code for smooth playback and efficient resource usage.
